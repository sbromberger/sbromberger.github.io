## About Seth Bromberger

Seth Bromberger has been involved in network and systems security for over nineteen years. His work history spans multiple industries and sectors including government, finance, and energy.

At [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](http://www.llnl.gov), Seth is exploring practical methods to improve the security of next-generation energy transmission and distribution systems. He is also Principal at [NCI Security LLC](http://www.ncisecurity.com), a consulting firm dedicated to the protection of domestic and international critical infrastructure. Previously, he was the Executive Vice President of Classified and Government Programs at Energy Sector Security Consortium, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization he co-founded in 2008.

An accomplished speaker, Seth [frequently presents](/pubs) on the subjects of critical infrastructure protection, industrial control system and network security, and the security of emerging energy technologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure and Smart Grid systems. He is an active participant in [several industry working groups](/highlights) and has been recognized in multiple sectors as a security thought leader and leading security practitioner.

In 2012, Seth was selected by [Smart Grid Today magazine](http://www.smartgridtoday.com/products/Smart-Grid-PIONEERS-2012.cfm) as one of its Smart Grid Pioneers.

Seth's work on [large scale data analysis and multi-source correlation techniques](/projects#datacorrelation) resulted in his being the listed inventor on [patent application 13/339,509, “System And Method For Monitoring a Utility Meter Network”](http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20120232915.PGNR.), which describes the [TopSight](/projects/#topsight) system he developed to detect anomalous behavior in a multi-million node Smart Meter network while at [Pacific Gas and Electric Company](http://www.pge.com). He is also co-developer of the system described in [patent application PCT/US2013/026504, “Method and System for Packet Acquisition, Analysis and Intrusion Detection in Field Area Networks”](http://www.bromberger.com/files/US20140204799.pdf) which is being used by utilities to analyze the complex interactions among devices participating in large-scale mesh networks. Most recently, Seth conceived and developed the [NetCanary](http://www.netcanary.com) system which is designed to detect reconnaissance attempts against critical infrastructure and other systems.
