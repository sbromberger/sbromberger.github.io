I'm Seth Bromberger. I create and manage security programs and organizations, focusing particularly on critical infrastructure (industries like energy, finance, manufacturing, and IT).

I am an Applied Research Scientist at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](http://www.llnl.gov), exploring security issues affecting critical infrastructure. I occasionally [develop](/projects#topsight) [tools](http://netcanary.com) to solve interesting security problems. More often, I find ways to use existing research and tools in novel security contexts.

I also [write a bit of code](https://github.com/sbromberger) that helps me do my work.
