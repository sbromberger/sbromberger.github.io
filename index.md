I'm Seth Bromberger. I create and manage security programs and organizations, focusing particularly on critical infrastructure (industries like energy, finance, manufacturing, and IT).

In addition to managing [my security consulting practice](http://www.ncisecurity.com), I work at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](http://www.llnl.gov) as an Applied Research Scientist, exploring security issues affecting critical infrastructure, and occasionally [develop](/projects#topsight) [tools](http://netcanary.org) to solve interesting security problems. More often, I find ways to use existing research and tools in a novel security context.

I also [write a bit of code](https://github.com/sbromberger) that helps me do my work.
